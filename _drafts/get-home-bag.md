# Get Home Bag

After yet another natural distaster around here with flooding all over the country as a result of Cyclone Cook, I find myself once again thinking about emergency kits. I do quite a lot of thinking on this front, but very little action. I get the feeling I'm not alone in this, and my fellow Google-warriors might be having a similar experience to mine: most of the survival stuff out there leans towards hyperbole at best.

## Survivalism
I don't want to fall under this heading. I'm not trying to be a "prepper" or to get ready for the zombie apocalypse. Like many New Zealanders, I am just a bit worried that the next thing might happen to me (for some of us, again). What this means is that for once (yeah right), Google is a little less than helpful. The web is not forthcoming with sensible, realistic advice for me. It tries to sell me [pre-packaged emergency kits](http://www.survive-it.co.nz/grab-n-go-bags/) or remind me that I'll need to [protect myself](https://www.thebugoutbagguide.com/tuusk-the-ultimate-urban-survival-kit/#Breaching_and_Self-Defense) against all those nasy neighbours that will want to fight me for my hard-earned survival gear.
